# Single-View Citiscape Reconstruction In-the-Wild

##*-- Project Paused for Work --*

## Why this project?

In digital content creation, the challenge of replicating complex
environments from a single images as references is well-known.
This project proposes a novel solution: reconstructing 3D cityscape
from single images, reducing the effort required to attain usable
digital twin. However, due to the inherent limitations of single
image methods, complete coverage of the may not be achieved,
resulting in some information loss.

The framework consists of stages including Primitive Segmentation,
Primitive 3D reconstruction, Position Mapping for Primitives, and
Primitive Grounding. Each stage contributes to transforming city image
in-the-wild into dynamic, immersive scenes. Through this research,
we aim to advance digital content creation and immersive experience
technologies by breaking the limitations of single-image reconstruction
methods.
